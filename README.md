# Pizza-Store-Dashboard-PowerBi
 Project Overview
The objective of this project was to analyze the sales data provided in Kaggle and uncover patterns, trends, and key performance indicators (KPIs) to better understand the success of the store. The data includes details such as order timestamps, pizza types, sizes, quantities, prices, and ingredients, which were meticulously analyzed to gain meaningful insights.

Tools and Techniques Used
Power BI: Leveraged the power of Power Query and DAX functions to transform and model the raw data into actionable insights.
Power Query: Employed data transformation techniques, including conditional columns, calculated measures, and modeling, to uncover hidden patterns and trends.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Utilized DAX functions to perform calculations and create custom measures for analyzing the data.

 Key Questions Addressed
Throughout the analysis, the project sought to answer several key questions, including:

Daily, monthly, and hourly sales trends: Unveiling the patterns that contribute to the success of the store.
Peak hour order influx: Identifying the busiest hours with the highest number of orders.
Best performing pizzas: Determining the pizzas that excel in terms of sales.
